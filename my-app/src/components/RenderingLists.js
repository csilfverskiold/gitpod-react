// Return statement: 
// "I'll create a new arrow function that takes a book as a parameter, and returns 
// an H2 element containing the book. Now I can save the file and see each book rendered in the UI. 
// So what is happening here, is the map method is iterating over each book in the booklist, and 
// returning each book wrapped up in an h2 element. This is functionally identical to the for loops 
// youâ€™re familiar with from vanilla JavaScript."

// "map() is like a for loop but cooler. Don't be repetetive and use copy/paste, use map() instead."

// Key props:
// "... If  you open the console and refresh the app, you'll see a warning: Each child in a list should 
// have a unique "key" prop. What this is telling you is that for each  element that you render in a list, 
// in our case, for each book, it must have a prop called 'key' which identifies it uniquely, like a 
// primary key in a database. This unique identifier is used by  React to keep track of which elements need to 
// be rerendered whenever the component is updated."
// "... take special note that even though these first two calls to the map method do not render a React  component, 
// they can still take this special prop called key, and in fact, it's required  that you pass it whenever rendering lists 
// of items whether they are divs, headings,  paragraphs, components or anything else."
// "As far as which element the key goes on, always  put the key on the outermost element that will be repeated, for example 
// we put the key  on the div in the second example here, not on any of the elements inside it."
